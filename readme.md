iData



iData was a project I made during high school, it aimed to provide an online cloud solution to upload, share and edit documents.

It was possible to:

• Signup for an account (1Gb for free if I remember well)
• Upload documents (videos, photos, texts)
• An icon was designed for each kind of documents
• A text editor (.txt) was available
• A software for managing finances was also made


Warning : The code is provided "as is" with no gurantee. The software may be unstable and unreliable : cryptographic functions might not be up to date and flaws may exist. No update will be provided, I had created this project to illustrate a few things I had learned with PHP and HTML.

I had much fun doing this even though it's completely outdated nowadays.

There are two .sql files associated with this project, they contain structures for users data.



That's all folks !
